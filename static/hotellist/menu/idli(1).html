                <h1>Directions</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>First of all start by washing the rice and dal separately. Now soak them separately as well.</li>
                    <li>Now drain the rice and add some water to it, now grind them in a mixer. Do this until it becomes a paste.</li>
                    <li>Now start by draining the dal and add some water to it, then start grinding it, keep adding water to make a fine paste. Make sure that rice paste is coarse while the lentil paste is done fine.</li>
                    <li>Now mix both the paste and add salt in it. Then keep the batter overnight at a dry place. Batter will become sour overnight.</li>
                    <li>The entire process takes 24 hours approximately.</li>
                    <li>Start by mixing the batter once. Do this gently, you would not want the air bubbles to go out completely. Then rub some oil on the idli molds.</li>
                    <li>Now start dropping batter in each mold accordingly. Then add approximately 1 inch deep water in the idli steamer. Now place the idli stand in the steamer and close it. Then steam it on high for about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Then low the steamer and keep it like that for about another 5 minutes. Then open the steamer and check the idli, if it is done, if not then steam it for about 2-3 minutes more.</li>
                    <li>Now, take the steamer and take out the idles from each mold. To do that you can either use a knife or a spoon.</li>
                    <li>Idlis are best served with chutneys and sambar.</li>
